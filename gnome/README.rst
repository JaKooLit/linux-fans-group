MANDATORY
+++++++++++++

Extension manager
   
   Self-contained, within an app, extension management. No website 
   BS. Search, add, disable, update and config extensions in a native 
   app. Install before all other gnome extension apps.
   
   - `From Flatpak.org <https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager>`_
   
   - `From github <https://github.com/mjakeman/extension-manager>`_

   Handy GUI plugin that lets you control, monitor, and manage snap 
   tasks and packages
   
DING
   
   desktop icon enabler
   
Kill App
   
   kill9 GUI button. (Should be called xkillthis)
   
Hide Accessibility
   
   Removes the icon with options still enabled. (I use large text but 
   hate having the accessibility icon taking up space in my top bar, 
   this removes that but leaves the functionality).
